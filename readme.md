## Architectural Pattern Used.

I used the Model View Controller Architectural Pattern

- Model View Controller (MVC)
  Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern that involves the separation of the application logic into three interconnected elements the Model, View, and Controller.

I maintained Separation of Concern (SoC) technique. Separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating software applications into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a Software Application.

## Code Structure.

I used the Model-Routes-Controllers-Services Code Structure.
